    "I started blogging on [www.acgeospatial.co.uk](http://www.acgeospatial.co.uk) in May 2016, since then I have gone on to write (at the time of writing Dec 2019) over 120 blog posts. I loosely write around the topic of Earth Observation and Satellite imagery but also more generally on Geospatial topics. GIS was my background. I am a Geographer (mainly Physical Geography) who was just super interested in computing. My degree gave me virtually no exposure to computing (it was 1998-2001) and in 2002 I took a MSc in GIS. That year the programming side of the course was in Java, it was enough to put me off programming for many years. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "I got interested in customising ArcView 3.2, building a GUI was fun and as ArcView migrated to version 8 (to match ArcInfo), vba and ArcObjects became more important. I was still interested in building tools to use within Arc. When ArcGIS moved to Python I was slow to move, another language to learn!<br>\n",
    "Slowly though and increasingly driven by open source (but not entirely open source GIS) I started using Pyton 2.7. Setting up was a killer, getting it compatible with ArcGIS and GDAL was costing many work hours. I didn't want to dive head first into a package manager, I just wanted to get it working. GIS wasn't an enabler, it was an outsider still.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Fortunately things have changed significantly now and GIS functions widely available in many Python libraries. You don't have to rely upon proprietary software anymore, vitually everything you want to achieve can be done open source. I started off just wanting to get something working and then I discovered other things on the way. My blog is a good example of how/when I discovered new ideas/programming techniques/interfaces etc. I was slow to Jupyter Notebooks, but now they dominate (though I realise they are not without there limitations), I was slow to anaconda - but now I only use anaconda as a package manager. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Why then do I say all these things. Firstly its hard, look around and people are shouting about cool stuff they have done with machine learning or image processing. What people don't tend to share is that it has taken them 5 hours to get one piece of code working. Its not magic, its hard work, its practice, it can be fun, it can be frustrating, it can sometimes just be not worth it. Secondly its a reminder to me, I am still learning. The way I have learn the best is to share what I have done, and then later to teach it. I am open to help, though I don't ask for it enough. I am indebted to stackoverflow, without it I would have given up. Also to the community of bloggers and youtubers who share content. I don't intentionally steal any content, I do however try to build and integrate ideas I have seen especially outside of the Geospatial world and apply them to what I am interested in."

    "That was alot of waffle, perhaps you read it. If so thanks, it took me a while to type. This repo on github is all about me reorganising the https://github.com/acgeospatial/Satellite_Imagery_Python I have been updating periodically for about 2 years. I don't really pay attention to the number of stars and forks on github, but I just looked 33 stars and 21 forks is beyond my comprehension. The fact that over 160 people follow my github account astonishes me. Thankyou. <br>\n",
